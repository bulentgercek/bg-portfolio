Anadolu Insurance | Fire Campaign Posters
In these poster works, which are a part of a campaign prepared by TBWA for Anadolu Insurance in 2012, the importance of insurance was emphasized by placing flammable match tips on the toes of world-famous design objects. The objects in the works were modeled by me with Softimage 3D.
